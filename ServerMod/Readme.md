__!! ServerMod only work on the current stable version 4491 !!__

ServerMod is a plugin that adds some commands to the server, accessible by the host and players.\
All the commands are prefixed by '!'.

Commands have 3 permission levels:
* __HOST__: Only the host can use the command
* __ALL__: All players can use the command
* __LOCAL__: Client-side command

Some commands with __ALL__ permission level can also be used when you are a client.

# Command list (alphabetized):

Permission: __HOST__\

When auto mode is activated, the server will automatically jump to the next level when all players finish.\

Auto mode doesn't work with Trackmogrify.
